            <h1 id="main-heading">Programming Languages </h1>
            <p class="main-para">Programming languages are the backbone of modern computing. They enable developers to
                create software applications and systems that power everything from smartphones and web applications to
                artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. There are hundreds of programming languages in use today,
                each with its own unique syntax, features, and applications.</p>

            <p class="main-para1"> One of the most popular programming languages is Java. Developed by Sun Microsystems
                in the mid-1990s,
                Java is a class-based, object-oriented language that is designed to be portable, meaning it can run on
                any platform without the need for recompilation. Java is used to build everything from mobile
                applications to web applications and large-scale enterprise systems.</p>

            <p class="main-para1"> Another popular language is Python. Known for its simplicity and ease of use, Python
                is a high-level,
                interpreted language that is used in a wide range of applications, from scientific computing to machine
                learning and web development. Python is often used by data scientists, researchers, and hobbyists due to
                its flexibility and readability.</p>

                <h1 class="sub">JAVA</h1>
                <p class="main-para">Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was originally
                    developed by Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation). It was released in
                    1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Java is known
                    for its portability, meaning that it can be run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine
                    (JVM) installed.</p>

                <p class="main-para1"> One of the key features of Java is its platform independence. Java code is
                    compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any platform that has a JVM installed. This means that
                    Java applications can be developed on one platform and run on any other platform without
                    modification. Java is also known for its robustness, which means that it is resistant to errors and
                    can handle unexpected situations gracefully.</p>

                <p class="main-para1">Java is widely used in a variety of applications, including desktop applications,
                    web applications, mobile applications, and enterprise applications. Java is also used extensively in
                    the development of Android mobile applications. Java's popularity is due in part to its large and
                    active community, which has created a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools to support Java
                    development.</p>

                <p class="main-para1">Java is an object-oriented language, which means that it uses objects to represent
                    data and functionality. Java supports several features of object-oriented programming, including
                    encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Java also includes support for multithreading, which
                    allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single program.
                    In addition to the core Java language, there are several frameworks and libraries available that
                    make it easier to develop Java applications. Some popular Java frameworks include Spring, Hibernate,
                    and Struts. These frameworks provide a set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to develop
                    complex applications.</p>

                <p class="main-para1"> Overall, Java is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely
                    used in many industries. Its platform independence, robustness, and object-oriented features make it
                    an ideal language for developing a wide variety of applications.</p>

                <p class="main-para">C++ is a general-purpose, compiled programming language designed for systems and
                    application programming. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 as an extension of the C
                    programming language. C++ is known for its high performance, efficiency, and flexibility.</p>

                <p class="main-para1">C++ is an object-oriented language, which means it supports the concepts of
                    objects and classes. Objects are instances of classes, which are user-defined data types that
                    contain data members and member functions. C++ also supports features like inheritance,
                    polymorphism, and encapsulation.</p>

                <p class="main-para1">C++ is a compiled language, meaning that source code must be compiled into machine
                    code before it can be executed. It can be compiled on a variety of platforms, including Windows,
                    macOS, and Linux.</p>

                <p class="main-para1">C++ has a wide range of applications, including operating systems, device drivers,
                    video games, scientific simulations, financial systems, and more. It is a popular language for
                    developing high-performance applications and is used extensively in industries such as finance,
                    engineering, and gaming.</p>

                <p class="main-para1">JavaScript is primarily used on the client-side of web development, which means it
                    runs directly in a web browser and is responsible for creating interactive user interfaces and
                    providing dynamic behavior to web pages. However, it can also be used on the server-side, with the
                    help of platforms like Node.js.</p>

                <p class="main-para1">JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world,
                    and it is an essential tool for any web developer. It is used extensively in front-end development,
                    as well as in back-end development with the help of Node.js. JavaScript also has a large and active

            <!-- <p class="main-para1"><span class="special">C++</span> is another commonly used programming language. It is a high-performance, object-oriented language
                that is used to develop applications that require speed and efficiency, such as video games, operating
                systems, and embedded systems. C++ is often used in conjunction with other languages, such as Python or
                Java, to build complex software systems.</p> -->

            <!-- <p class="main-para1"> <span  class="special">JavaScript</span> is the primary language used for front-end web development. It is a dynamic, object-oriented
                language that is used to create interactive web applications and user interfaces. JavaScript is often
                used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages that respond to user interactions and
                events.</p> -->
            <!-- <p class="main-para1">In conclusion, programming languages are a crucial tool for developers and are used to create everything from simple scripts to complex applications. The choice of programming language depends on the specific needs of the application, and developers must balance factors such as performance, ease of use, and community support when selecting a language. With so many languages to choose from, there is a language for every project and every developer.</p> -->
